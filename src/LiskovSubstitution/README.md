The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. It states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, if a class S is a subclass of class T, then objects of type T should be able to be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.).

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, subclasses should:

Implement all the methods defined in the superclass.
Behave in ways expected based on the superclass specification. This means that subclasses should not violate the expected behavior of the methods they inherit.

In this `Before` example, the Penguin class violates the Liskov Substitution Principle because it changes the behavior of the fly method in a way that is unexpected for users of the Bird class.

Correcting the Example
To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, we need to ensure that the behavior remains consistent with the expectations set by the superclass. We can introduce a new superclass or interface to better represent the behavior of Birds that can and cannot fly.

By restructuring our classes and interfaces, we ensure that objects of subclasses can be substituted for objects of their parent class without introducing unexpected behavior, thus adhering to the Liskov Substitution Principle.
